Technologies used in this project, Jupyter notebook, Sklearn for model building, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, Python, Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning

Explanation about folder structure files 

Dataset: Contains images used to train model 

opencv: contains algorithms for face detection

test image: contains images to try opencv and Matplotlin and Seaborn

Celecrity classification.ipynb: contains the code created on Jupyter notebook to create model. Make changes to it as necessary

classdictionary: A specific number is given to each person for model traning 

savedmodel.pkl: 
Trained model-To train your own model with different images you can use the dataset folder and add your images there

Steps
1. Data Collection

collect images and separte each person image in separate folders

2. Data Cleaning

use the code to crop the face and create them in cropped folder in dataset. Manually check cropped photos to ensure no inconsistent images. These cropped images will be used to train the model.

3. Training Model

Trained model- using raw images and wavelet transformed images to perform vertical stacking of them and train model and then hyper tune it!
Wavelet transformed imaged- to extract features from a cropped image!
GridSearch used to try different models with different parameters and come up with best model and parameters

Note: if following error is given while running code : error: OpenCV(4.6.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor'- Delete cropped folder manually if present and rerun code
